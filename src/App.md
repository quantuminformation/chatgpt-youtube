All components are to be stored relatively in ./components/

Write me a parent React TSX component called App.tsx and two page components:
LocateMe.tsx which renders locate me
LocateMe2.tsx which renders locate me 2

App.tsx renders the components as lazy loaded routes in a React BrowserRouter, these routes should be wrapped in Routes and the Route should use the element attribute instead of component.

Include a nav for these page components on the left side of the App.tsx page

The App component export should be a named export
