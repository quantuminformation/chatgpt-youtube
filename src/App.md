Write me named export React TSX full width component called App.tsx which imports these page components already created in ./components: 

BitcoinChart.tsx
LocateMe.tsx

App.tsx renders the components as lazy loaded routes in a React BrowserRouter v6, these routes should be wrapped in Routes and the Route should use the element attribute instead of component. DO NOT USE activeClassName ANYWHERE

Include a nav for these page components on the left side of the App.tsx page.

Store any css within the App.tsx.

Make the styling high contrast and nice on the eyes
