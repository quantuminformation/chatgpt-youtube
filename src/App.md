Write me named export Solidjs TSX full width component called App.tsx which imports these page components already created in ./components: 

BitcoinChart.tsx
LocateMe.tsx

App.tsx renders the components as lazy loaded routes, these routes should be wrapped in Routes and the Route should use the element attribute instead of component.

Include a nav for these page components and components/GoogleMapsAutocompleteInput.tsx on the top of the page.

Css should be clean and minimal

Make the styling high contrast and nice on the eyes
